description: My first post
---

This is my first post in my first blog at github.
It's beginning of my blog life! 아자잣! =:)

I'll run this blog focus on study about software, coding, programming, etc.
Currently I am newbie in programming, so I have tons of skills to learn.
This means I have tons of post to write. :)

As an asides, after serveral minutes of searching internet,
I learned that markdown language can be used for write a post in github blog.
But I'm not familiar with markdown language, so currently it is little bit hard to write a post.

Okay, so...

See ya!
