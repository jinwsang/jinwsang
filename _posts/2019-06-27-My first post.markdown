<hr/>

This is my first post in my first blog at github

After servere minutes of searching internet,
I knew that markdown language can be used for write a post in github blog.
But I'm not familiar with markdown language, so currently it is little bit hard to write a post.

Anyway...
There will be a post which is study on software, coding, programming only.

mmm... Okay, this is it.

See ya next time. =:)
